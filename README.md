We want to make it easy for new and experienced athletes to discover calisthenics parks in Norway.

The goal of pullups.no is to show all the calisthenics parks of Norway in one map. 

Planned features:

Short term:
* Add image upload and image thumbnails on marker popups
* Add small pullups locations, such as playgrounds and single pullup bars. Make small markers for these ones
* Add about page and contribution form
* Add more information to the popups, such as star rating, type of turf and list of equipment

Long term:
* Add feature where people can check into different parks and gain points
* Community features, e.g instagram feed for posts with #pullups.no, forums, links to relevant websites, such as exercise plans
